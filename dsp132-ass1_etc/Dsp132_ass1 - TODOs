Dsp132 - TODOs
===============

Current status - Manager creates workers (i.e. setup instances, and activate jars), and working fine with queues.


1. Rmove all hardcoded details, base all on inputs and LocalApp (queues names, s3 bucket + keys names, jars).
2. Deal with cases when Manager is not terminated (i.e. reboot manager in order to make sure it will run the script).
3. Note that jar needs to be compiled with 1.6 jdk, in order to run properly on remote machines!
